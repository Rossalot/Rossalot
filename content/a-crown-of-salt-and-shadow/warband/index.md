title: The Last Wanderings of Athel Loren
description: A warband built around the vintage Skaw the Falconer mini. I leaned into my memory of the 90s style to paint up the elves I always dreamed of having as a child - included actual vintage Goblin Green paint on the base rims. The 'melting in to starlight' effect is part of the warband's story, as they actually memories escaped from the World That Was and are slowly melting away.
